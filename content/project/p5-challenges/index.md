## Coding in p5.js
One of the first things I've done when I started learning programming was to learn how to code in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) because javascript was fairly easy to learn and p5.js was a fun way to learn it.  
I've followed [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) on YouTube and coded along with him. With his videos I used to code a lot of "challenges". Now I've decided to start coding them again and post them here.  

I'll be posting the challenges to [this page](https://firatbatar.com/p5-challenges) and I'll be posting the code to [this repository](https://github.com/firatbatar/p5-challenges). More details about the challenges can be found on the page and the GitHub repo.
